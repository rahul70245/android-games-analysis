# android-games-analysis
Technology used in this analysis project is Power BI and Excel. For doing this project I have taken raw data from kaggle. It has 11 columns and approximately 110 rows.In this first thing I did was
to clean the data properly as it was raw unclean data and had many duplicacy issues. The objective of this project was to predict which categories games are performing well in the market so that
new gaming company can use that information and second reason was the existing gaming companies can see where they stand and improve their product.
